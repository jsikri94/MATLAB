# Spectral clustering on  predefined data points

-- circs.m produces the data points that need to be clustered.

-- plot_cluster.m plots these data points, after clustering has been performed. One cluster is represented by red data points whereas the  second cluster is represented by yellow data points.

-- similarityMatrix.m calculates the similarities between the data points, for different values of sigma, in the form of a matrix.

-- spec_clustering.m clusters the data points
